# Project Description

This is the repository for my 2022 Resume website. This website's code was created by:

1.) Starting with my LootQuest3 project*
2.) Reducing the project down to a mostly empty template (getting rid of .git, Jest and other dependencies, all the game elements, etc.)
3.) Adding the W3Schools template*
4.) Converting W3Schools template to react and breaking down various sections into components.
5.) Customizing the new project template to its current form.

-   LootQuest3 project: https://github.com/Destro168/LootQuest3
    \*\* W3 Schools template: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryw3css_templates_cv.htm

This project is not intended to demonstrate 'advanced skills' in any way, which is why I used quick and dirty methods via steps 1-4 to bootstrap the project rapidly.
